 §2§ Abstract §2§

   The charge density distribution of a protein has been refined
   experimentally. Diffraction data for a crambin crystal were measured to
   ultra-high resolution (0.54 Å) at low temperature by using
   short-wavelength synchrotron radiation. The crystal structure was
   refined with a model for charged, nonspherical, multipolar atoms to
   accurately describe the molecular electron density distribution. The
   refined parameters agree within 25% with our transferable electron
   density library derived from accurate single crystal diffraction
   analyses of several amino acids and small peptides. The resulting
   electron density maps of redistributed valence electrons (deformation
   maps) compare quantitatively well with a high-level quantum mechanical
   calculation performed on a monopeptide. This study provides validation
   for experimentally derived parameters and a window into charge density
   analysis of biological macromolecules.

   The electronic charge density distribution of a molecule carries
   information ([30]1) that determines its intermolecular interactions.
   For example, the charge distribution of an enzyme complements that of
   the substrate it recognizes and binds. The electrostatic potential and
   electric moments derivable from the charge density ([31]1–[32]3)
   provide maps that can guide the design of molecules for specified
   interactions. Furthermore, powerful insights into the nature and
   strength of hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions result from
   analysis of the electron density gradient and Laplacian ([33]4–[34]6).
   Extension of such analyses to proteins would permit a unique
   understanding of the driving forces between biomolecules as well as the
   subtleties of enzymatic reactions ([35]7).

   Experimental electron density distributions are obtained by analysis of
   single-crystal x-ray diffraction data measured to ultra-high
   resolution, typically to a diffraction resolution limit d [min] ≈ 0.5 Å
   ([36]1, [37]8, [38]9). The crystallographic studies usually map and
   analyze the deformation density, which is the difference between the
   actual electron density of the molecule and the density calculated for
   the promolecule, a molecular superposition of spherical, neutral, i.e.,
   free, atoms. The deformation density thus reveals the redistribution of
   valence electron density caused by chemical bonding and intermolecular
   interactions and also is used to calibrate theoretical electron density
   calculations ([39]10). However, a difficulty in crystallography is the
   separation of the anisotropic atomic mean-square displacements from the
   static molecular electron distribution ([40]11). Proper experimental
   deconvolution requires very accurate diffraction data to ultra-high
   resolution. Thus, charge density studies have so far been limited to
   small-unit-cell crystals, and proteins still await study.

   We have shown ([41]12, [42]13) that effective thermal displacement
   deconvolution and meaningful deformation density distributions can be
   achieved for larger structures at lower resolution by transferring
   average experimental electron density parameters. We have built a
   database of such parameters derived from ultra-high resolution crystal
   structures of amino acids and small peptides that are transferable to
   polypeptides and small proteins. The limits of the transferability have
   been analyzed in a study of a helical octapeptide with diffraction data
   to d [min] = 0.82-Å resolution ([43]13). The deformation density showed
   well-defined bond peaks between atoms with small to moderate
   displacement parameters (B [eq] < 4 Å^2) when the Fourier synthesis was
   performed with diffraction data complete to at least 0.9-Å resolution.
   The analysis also yielded partial atomic charges that compare well with
   the charges in the amber ([44]14) molecular modeling dictionary.

   Here we report on the crystallographic charge density refinement of a
   protein, crambin (46 residues), which is present in seeds of Crambe
   abyssinica and homologous to membrane-active plant toxins ([45]15). The
   structure of the protein (Fig. [46]1) at a resolution of 0.83 Å already
   has been analyzed extensively to determine deviations from peptide
   backbone geometry, crystallographic water structure, and disorder
   correlations ([47]17–[48]19).

 §2§ Materials and Methods §2§

 §3§ Data Collection. §3§

   Crambin was purified and crystallized as described ([56]17). The
   crystals belong to the space group P2[1] with unit cell parameters a =
   40.82; b = 18.49; c = 22.37 Å; β = 90.47°, and one molecule per
   asymmetric unit. X-ray diffraction data from a single crambin crystal
   at T = 100 K were measured to d [min] = 0.54 Å by using λ = 0.54 Å
   synchrotron radiation and a 300-mm MarResearch imaging plate detector
   at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory BW7A beamline at the DORIS
   storage ring, Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg. Using the
   denzo ([57]20) and drear ([58]21, [59]22) program suites, the data were
   reduced to a 97.6% complete data set (Table [60]1). The structure was
   refined against all of the reflections, except 5% of them used to
   compute the free-R crystallographic residual ([61]23).

 §3§ Electron Density Modeling. §3§

   The electron density analysis used a simplified Hansen and Coppens
   ([64]24) multipolar pseudoatom model, Formula Formula The first two
   terms on the right describe spherically symmetric core-plus-valence
   density, and the third term describes nonspherical, multipolar
   redistribution of valence-shell density caused by chemical bonding. The
   valence-shell electron populations P [val] adjust for inter-atomic
   charge transfer, and the multipole populations P [lm] for aspherical
   intra-atomic redistribution of valence electron density. The R [l] are
   Slater-type radial functions, and the Y [lm±] are real spherical
   harmonic angular functions (see ref. [65]24 for more details). The
   dilatation coefficients of the spherical (κ) and multipolar (κ′)
   valence electron density were not considered as variables and were set
   to the standard value of unity (κ = 1.16 for hydrogen atoms).

   The present analysis was performed by using the mopro least-squares
   computer program (C.J. and C.L., unpublished work) for multipolar
   charged atom modeling, which is a version of molly ([66]24) extensively
   modified for protein applications. The conjugate gradient method has
   been implemented, and stereochemical restraints, analogous to those of
   the shelxl-97 structure refinement program ([67]25) have been
   introduced. Distance restraints were applied in the disordered parts of
   the structure. To facilitate the deconvolution of the deformation
   density from vibrational smearing, rigid bond ([68]11) restraints were
   applied to the thermal displacement parameters. All of the hydrogen
   atoms in the ordered part of crambin were located in Fourier difference
   maps. For nonhydrogen atoms, the multipole expansions included the
   monopolar, dipolar, quadrupolar, and octupolar terms that have
   significantly nonzero P [lm] values in the amino acid and peptide
   database ([69]12, [70]13). For hydrogen atoms, only the P [val]
   monopole and a dipole directed along the H-X covalent bond were
   included.

 §3§ Crystallographic Refinement. §3§

   The electron density modeling was done in three stages. In refinement
   I, a conventional, spherical, neutral atom model was used. Atomic
   positions, anisotropic displacement parameters, and site occupancies
   for solvent molecules and disordered protein atoms were refined by
   using the programs shelxl-97 ([71]25) and mopro successively.

   In refinement II, the multipolar charged atom model was applied with
   electron density parameters (valence population and multipoles)
   transferred from the database ([72]12, [73]13) to the protein
   polypeptide main chain. For the side chains, only the multipole
   parameters were transferred, as the valence populations P [val] show a
   lower degree of transferability in the database. Water molecules were
   considered spherical and neutral. The main-chain periodic moiety
   -H^αC^αCONH- was set to be globally electrically neutral; as the
   protein contains a variety of side chains, their global effect on the
   polypeptide main-chain charge can be expected to cancel out.

   The hydrogen atoms were moved outward along the X-H bond directions to
   adjust the bond lengths to the values expected from neutron diffraction
   studies ([74]26). The atomic positions and anisotropic thermal
   displacement parameters were refined (alternatively) further with fixed
   multipole and partial net charge parameters transferred from the
   database. To ensure that the structure “forgot” the spherical atom
   model, the temperature factors were annealed twice from random shifts
   of up to ± 10%. As the convergence was slow, at least 400 refinement
   cycles were necessary.

   In refinement III, the average electron density parameters for the
   polypeptide main chain were allowed to vary. All of the peptide groups
   -C^a(-H^a)-C(=O)-N(-H^N)- were constrained to be electrically neutral
   and equivalent. The disordered portions, accounting for 30% of the
   protein atoms, were modeled with fixed electron density parameters that
   were updated regularly during refinement III. The coordinates, the
   thermal displacement parameters, and the charge density parameters were
   refined alternatively.

 §3§ Charge Refinement. §3§

   Diffraction-derived atomic charges are given by q ^atom = N [val] ^atom
   − P [val] ^atom, where N [val] is the number of valence electrons in
   the neutral free atom and P [val] is the refined valence-shell
   population in the bound pseudoatom. Charges derived from the P [val]
   values might, however, be biased by effective charge transfer through
   the multipoles. To compensate for this bias, the P [val] parameters
   were refitted by using a spherical atom model. In this procedure
   ([75]27), only the valence population and dilatation coefficient were
   refined while the multipole population parameters were reset to and
   held fixed at P [lm] = 0, and the atomic positional and thermal
   parameters were held fixed at their refined values from refinement II
   or III.

 §3§ Electron Density Maps. §3§

   Residual maps were computed as Fourier transforms of the structure
   factor differences (|F [obs]| − |F [calc]|) exp (iφ[calc]).

   The experimental static deformation density was computed from the
   crystallographic modeling as the atomic superposition-sum over the
   molecule Δρ = Σ[atom] ρ[atom] ^multipolar − ρ[atom] ^spherical. This
   density is “static” in that it is computed for atoms at rest.

   A theoretical static deformation density Δρ = ρ[molecule] − Σ[atom]
   ρ[free-atom] had been computed from a wavefunction for a
   pseudo-monopeptide ([76]5) from an ab initio Hartree-Fock
   self-consistent-field molecular orbitals calculation performed with a
   triplezeta-plus-(C,N,O-d and H-p)-polarization-function Gaussian basis
   set.

   The dynamic experimental deformation electron density was obtained by
   Fourier transformation of the difference |F [obs]|exp(iΦ[calc]
   ^multipolar) − |F [calc] ^spherical|exp(iΦ[calc] ^spherical). This
   density is “dynamic” in that both the structure factor amplitudes and
   phases are affected by atomic thermal vibrational smearing. It is
   “experimental” in that the Fourier sum is truncated at the experimental
   diffraction resolution limit, and the |F [obs]| coefficients
   incorporate experimental error.

 §2§ Results §2§

 §3§ Residual Maps. §3§

   An important question is whether significant deviations from the
   spherical-atom approximation can be experimentally observed for
   proteins. To address this issue, the crambin structure was first
   refined classically, by using a spherical, neutral atom model
   (refinement I). The quality of the fit to this spherical scattering
   factor model was evaluated by residual electron density maps. These
   maps show systematic bonding density features (Fig. [79]2 A), but also
   contained a significant amount of random noise, which was not in favor
   of a charge density refinement for individual atoms.

   Taking advantage of the repetition of the same chemical motif along the
   polypeptide main chain, the signal to noise ratio of the crambin
   residual map was increased by averaging over the 34 nondisordered
   peptide groups (Fig. [84]2 B). The averaged map displayed significant
   positive residual density in the bonds between the nonhydrogen atoms
   (with a maximum Δρ = 0.12 e^−/Å^3 in the C^α-C bond), and negative
   residual density was found in the H^a and H^N hydrogen regions,
   indicating unmodeled electron depletion on the hydrogen atoms. These
   features in the residual map clearly demonstrate that the
   spherical-atom model does not provide an adequate fit to the
   experimental diffraction data ([85]13, [86]28).

   After transfer of the statistically significant multipoles from the
   database (Table [87]2 ), the residual features were greatly reduced in
   the peptide-averaged residual electron density (Fig. [88]2 C). In fact,
   residual bond densities were even negative, indicating that the
   deformation density transferred from the database ([89]12) needs
   further adjustments (V.P.-P., C.J., C.L., and B. Guillot, unpublished
   work).

   Table 2

   Average valence and multipole populations for the atoms of the
   polypeptide main chain

   The well-defined peaks on the covalent bonds as well as the low noise
   level in the averaged residual maps (Fig. [92]2 B and C) encouraged us
   to obtain chemically meaningful deformation densities for the
   main-chain peptide moiety. The average statistically significant
   multipole and partial net charge parameters of the peptide main-chain
   atoms thus were allowed to vary in the refinement. The resultant
   peptide-averaged residual density map (Fig. [93]2 D) showed
   substantially less negative residual density along the peptide bonds
   with |ΔΦ| < 0.06 e^−/Å^3. The progressive flattening of residual
   density features through the three stages of refinement (Fig. [94]2
   B–D) is convincing physical evidence of real improvement in the
   modeling. The remaining global negative residual density in the peptide
   bond plane (Fig. [95]2 D) may be caused by the constrains applied:
   first, the peptide moiety was constrained to be neutral; second, in
   this version of the database, only the multipoles that are
   significantly different from zero were considered and refined, and
   third, the dilatation coefficients of the valence density were fixed.
   Also the scale factor had decreased by 0.3% from the spherical atom
   model to the final refinement, which also might account for a global
   negative residual density.

 §3§ Crystallographic Statistics. §3§

   Although the spherical and multipolar atom models led to significantly
   different (averaged) residual densities, they yielded only slightly
   different values (Table [96]1) of their crystallographic amplitude
   agreement indices and their phase agreement statistics from free-R
   likelihood estimates computed with the rflexpl program ([97]29). The
   unweighted average phase error is 6.3° and 6.0° when using the
   spherical and multipolar atom model, respectively. The effect of the
   atomic model on the calculated phase also has been analyzed. The
   average phase difference between the spherical and multipolar
   refinements is <|ΔΦ|> = 3.8°, which is smaller than the estimated phase
   error itself. This difference is presumably small because the
   anisotropic thermal displacement parameters in a spherical atoms model
   can accommodate much of the valence density deformation ([98]13,
   [99]30) that should be properly described by a multipolar model. The
   importance of model testing against residual maps also must be
   emphasized.

 §3§ Electron Density Parameters. §3§

   The charge density refinement of the average peptide led to a realistic
   static deformation density, except for the peptide oxygen atom lone
   pairs. The charge density parameters of the oxygen atom therefore were
   readjusted to their database values. The oxygen lone pair density had
   indeed showed up less clearly than the bonding deformation density in
   Fig. [100]2 B. Proper refinement of the charge density parameters
   describing the oxygen lone pairs would require even higher-resolution
   diffraction data and a lower thermal motion as these features are only
   0.3 Å distant from the oxygen nucleus.

   As expected from the residual density in Fig. [101]2 C, the multipole
   populations on the peptide nonhydrogen atoms generally decreased from
   their database values in refinement III (Table [102]2), whereas for the
   peptide hydrogen atoms H^a and H^N the dipole populations increased by
   about 25%. This electron transfer in the H→X direction was compensated
   by a corresponding increase of the electronic populations P [val] on
   the hydrogen atoms (Table [103]2).

 §3§ Deformation Maps. §3§

   The static deformation density maps after transfer and refinement of
   the statistically significant multipoles (refinements II and III) are
   shown in Fig. [104]3 A and B. The two densities display a correlation
   coefficient of 0.89 in the peptide bond plane displayed in Fig. [105]3.
   As expected from Fig. [106]2 C, there is a decrease of the rms
   deformation density from 0.24 to 0.18 e^−/Å^3 in the peptide bond
   plane. The database deformation density is clearly overestimated, as
   the rms value computed on a sample of 13 experimental deformation maps
   of peptide bonds present in the database is 0.194 ± 0.005. A
   preliminary analysis of the current version of the database seems to
   indicate that the overestimation of the deformation density is caused
   by the dilatation coefficients κ and κ′, which were fixed to unity for
   the non-H atoms. When average contraction/expansion coefficients are
   used, the database deformation density has a rms value of 0.18, and the
   correlation coefficient with the crambin-derived map reaches 92%.

   database parameters. (B) Experimental static map obtained by using
   atomic charges and multipole parameters refined against the crambin
   diffraction data. (C) Theoretical static map computed for the
   pseudo-monopeptide (Z)-N-acetyl-α,β-dehydrophenylalanine methylamide
   ([111]5). (D) Experimental dynamic map for the peptide Ala-9–Arg-10 of
   crambin. The contour level is 0.05 e^−/Å^3. Positive: red lines;
   negative: blue lines.

   To further validate the results, the crambin experimental deformation
   density maps were compared with corresponding theoretical maps obtained
   from quantum mechanical calculations on the monopeptide (Z)-N-acetyl-α,
   β-dehydrophenylalanine methylamide ([112]5) (Fig. [113]3 C). The bond
   peak heights display an almost quantitative agreement in the two static
   maps (Fig. [114]3 B and C). The experimental and theoretical
   deformation densities have rms values of 0.18 and 0.20 e^−/Å^3,
   respectively and give a correlation coefficient of 0.88 (if the regions
   within 0.15-Å radius around the atomic nuclei are ignored). The
   excellent consistency between the experimental results of this charge
   density analysis of a protein and theoretical results for a high-level
   calculation on a small peptide is remarkable.

   According to the rms deformation densities, the 6–311G++ calculations
   on the monopeptide do not agree with the database transferred map,
   which again seems overestimated. The theoretical map has a rms
   deformation density (0.20) that is in good agreement with the
   experimental values found on 13 peptide bonds (0.194 ± 0.005) present
   in the database; it is, however, slightly higher than the crambin
   refined value (0.18).

   The slightly lower deformation density features of the crambin refined
   map might be caused by the less than small molecule quality of the
   diffraction data and by the higher thermal motion. This attenuation
   effect has been observed even more dramatically in the refinement of
   atomic charges (see next paragraph).

   A usual X-X refinement ([115]24), where the deformation density is in
   principle deconvoluted from the thermal motion, was not attempted, as
   the electron density residual in Fig. [116]2 B was weaker than what is
   usually observed for small molecules. Also, such a refinement is
   possible only for atoms with a sufficiently low thermal motion that
   have thus a contribution to the diffraction that extends to the
   subatomic resolution level (0.5 Å). The charge density parameters
   refinement turned out to have a slow convergence; it was thus performed
   only after the database transfer, which is a point close to the real
   structure and therefore yields the best coordinates and thermal
   displacement parameters ([117]12).

   To see the charge density on individual atoms, the (unaveraged) dynamic
   deformation map after refinement III has been computed. This density
   incorporates the thermal motion of the atoms and the errors of the
   diffraction data. The dynamic deformation density is shown in Fig.
   [118]3 D for the peptide bond Ala-9–Arg-10. The density peaks are
   generally visible on the covalent bonds; however, they are strongly
   affected by the vibrationnal smearing and presumably also by the noise
   in the diffraction data. As expected, lone-pair peaks on the oxygen
   atom are attenuated because of thermal-motion smearing.

 §3§ Atomic Charges Refinement. §3§

   An important longer-range aim of our studies is to determine
   experimental electrostatic parameters for biological macromolecules and
   to calibrate the theoretically derived electrostatic parameters used in
   biomolecular modeling calculations ([119]31). Net atomic charges can,
   for instance, be derived experimentally from x-ray diffraction data via
   pseudoatom modeling ([120]3, [121]27, [122]31). In analyses of
   small-molecule structures, spherical-atom charges refitted after
   multipolar refinements have been shown to yield molecular electric
   moments that agree well with independently measured experimental values
   ([123]3, [124]27).

   The refitted charges of the crambin peptide atoms after refinement II
   were: C^a +0.06, C +0.32, O −0.18, N −0.44, H^a +0.08, and H^N +0.16
   electrons. These are charges for volume-occupying spherical atoms, and
   they are chemically sensible, although generally smaller than the
   nuclear-centered effective point-charges in the amber molecular
   modeling dictionary ([125]14). The refitted charges after refinement
   III were further attenuated to unrealistically small values, despite
   the apparent reasonableness of the refined bonding deformation density.
   Presumably the refinement of atomic charges is more sensitive to the
   quality of the diffraction data, the scale factor calculation, and the
   level of thermal motion, and it requires more accurate data to even
   higher resolution.

 §2§ Discussion §2§

   The resolution (0.54 Å) and the quality of the crambin diffraction data
   presented in this study permit the refinement of the average multipole
   parameters for the polypeptide backbone, but not of the individual
   atoms as suggested by the noise level in the nonaveraged maps (Figs.
   [128]2 A and [129]3 D). With the availability of intense
   third-generation synchrotron sources, crystallographic data could be
   collected with high signal/noise ratios to even higher resolution for
   the current crambin crystals. This experiment might allow meaningful,
   nonaveraged, individual-atom charge density analysis for the inner
   region of the protein that has a low thermal motion. The high
   diffraction power of the crambin crystals with respect to protein
   crystallography is correlated with the low thermal displacement
   parameters of the protein atoms ([130]13); the median value is only B
   [eq] = 2.5 Å^2.

   This moderate thermal motion may be attributed to the three disulfide
   bridges present in the crambin structure, the small unit cell, and the
   tight crystal packing with only 30% (vol/vol) solvent, nearly all of
   which is ordered. Low thermal vibration (B [eq] < 4 Å^2) of the
   molecular structure is a prerequisite for measuring diffraction
   intensities to ultra-high resolution ([131]13). The thermal motion
   level in crambin is, however, high compared with usual values found in
   small molecules crystallography (B ≈1–2 Å^2).

   The work described here opens the way to numerous electron density
   studies for proteins, because atomic-resolution protein diffraction is
   becoming more and more accessible and accurate ([132]32). Depositions
   at the Protein Data Bank of crystal structures of small and even medium
   size proteins at resolutions better than 1.2 Å are becoming more
   frequent ([133]33). For instance, from crystals of human aldose
   reductase ([134]34), a 36-kDa protein, a diffraction data set to 0.65-Å
   resolution recently has been collected and the multipolar refinement is
   underway.

   Further enhancements in protein crystal diffraction to the ultra-high
   resolution level will extend the number of proteins that can be studied
   with electron density methods. Research in the manipulation of crystal
   growth conditions and the use of cryo-crystallography will be crucial.
   These techniques can reduce the crystal mosaicity and/or lower the
   attenuating contribution of the atomic displacement parameters to
   diffraction intensities. This study shows that, at least for small
   proteins, the collection of diffraction data to the subatomic level has
   become feasible because of the remarkable technological advances in
   synchrotron beamline facilities and area detectors.

   The determination of the charges and the electronic distribution for
   the atoms in the active site of enzymes will provide new information
   and enable a better understanding of their function ([135]7). Another
   important application of charge density to structural biology would be
   the determination of electronic properties and oxidation states of
   reactive metallic centers in redox and electron transfer
   metalloproteins. Ultra-high resolution crystallographic studies
   performed in parallel on metalloproteins and biomimetic compounds
   ([136]35, [137]36) in combination with quantum mechanical calculations
   will yield new insights into redox processes in biology. With the
   enhancement of charge density modeling, the development of the database
   of transferable parameters and the continued technological advances of
   experimental crystallography, analyzing the electronic structure of
   macrobiomolecules has considerable unexplored potential ([138]8).
